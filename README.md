# Electrical Power Subsystem
Matlab application for Spacecraft Subsystems course assignment in MS Spacecraft Design at LTU Space Campus.

## Exercise 1
You are designing a spacecraft that will use gallium arsenide solar cells for power production for a near-Earth mission for the observation of equatorial regions. The following requirements and parameters concerning the EPS are given as input:

- Time in daylight: 68 min
- Time in eclipse: 22 min
- Power required in daylight: 330 W
- Power required in eclipse: 100 W
- Path efficiency in daylight: 0.85
- Path efficiency in eclipse: 0.65
- Nominal mission duration: 5 years
- Life degradation per year: 2.75%
- Limit on battery's depth of charge: 20%
- One battery on the spacecraft.
- Battery average discharge voltage: 27.1 V
- Transmission efficiency between the battery and the load: 90%

If some data are not given, use the tables or make some hypothesis.

1. What is the power required from the solar array during the daylight periods?
2. What is the beginning-of-life power per unit area of the solar array? Assume worst-case Sun angle and nominal inherent degradation.
3. What is the end-of-life power per unit area of the solar array?
4. What is the required area of the solar arrays?
5. What is the required capacity of the secondary batteries of the spacecraft (in W hr and A hr?
6. What is the mass of the batteries if they are Ni-H2? What is the mass of the batteries if we are using Li-Ion? What is the mass of the batteries if they are Ni-Cd?
7. Why are the majority of the spacecraft power systems direct-current (dc) vice alternating-current (ac)?


## Exercise 2
The nominal power consumption of a spacecraft orbiting in a 1000 km sun-synchronous noon-midnight circular orbit is 833.3 W. Assuming that the electrical power system is unregulated, calculate:

1. The duration of the discharge of the battery.
2. The battery discharge energy.
3. The duration of the recharging phase of the battery.
4. Assuming that the recharge efficiency is 0.8, calculate the required recharge energy and recharge power.
5. The total spacecraft power to be supplied by the solar array during the sunlight phase.
6. The area and the weight of the GaAs solar arrays assuming that the mission lifetime is 5 years and the solar panels are always directed towards the sun.
7. The number of the solar cells to be put in series per each string of the solar array assuming that the nominal bus voltage is 28V. How many strings are necessary in the solar array?
8. Using the following figureimm1.jpg, estimate the allowable DOD for both the Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries.
9. Calculate the required battery capacity for both Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries.
10. The mass of the battery pack if we are using Ni-Cd or Ni-H2 batteries.
11. The number of the battery cells necessary to assure a bus voltage 28 V.


## Exercise 3
Compute the ratio of battery recharge power to spacecraft operating power for noon-midnight circular orbits of 500km , 5000km and 50000km altitude. Assume that the recharge efficiency is 80%.
